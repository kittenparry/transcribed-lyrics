### Abyss
You lost your home`/`hope  
You lost your dream  
Why are we marching`*` in perfect harmony  
Cause you carry the burden  
Lost`*` this nightmare  
Only `?`  
Before the `?`  
`?-?`  
You will find your way out

`chorus:`  
`?-?`  
`?-?`  
Memories carry on`*` your tears away  
`?-?`  
Save me  
`?` this level of shame and pain  
Wash away all the sins `?`  
`?-?`

Carry us away  
Our hearts`*` are `?`  
`?-?`  
`?-?`  
We'll wait till the end  
There`*` is no tomorrow  
We'll wait till the end  
End of our `?`

Star`~` `?`  
`?-?`  
Too late to `?`  
Too late to `?`  

`?-?`  
`?-?`  
`?-?`  
Carry us far`*` away  
`?-?`  
Before we leave this world  
`?-?`  

We have been crying for so long  
`?-?`  
Will we see the light in the end  
`?-?`  
`?-?`
