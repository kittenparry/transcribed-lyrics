### Reminiscence Part III: Home
I will go down  
I will drown drown deeper down  
This river bed will be my last ride  
Still you will not be by my side

Tell me when you will come back home  

I was trying to find a way to go  
With`*` a place where everything's so cold  
And `?` will show me where I should go  
Even if it's impossible

Reminiscence  
How can I `?`  
`?-?`  
Before I lose `?`  
If I face`*` the innocence  
Maybe I'll be able  
Able to see you again

Remember that night when you closed your eyes  
Years have passed but I still can not realise  
These are memories I don't want to hide

I'm so sorry  
But I believe `(it is late)*`  
The pain is far beyond compare  
And I know my time has come to say farewell  
`?-?`
