### Falter
`?-?`  
I live in a nightmare but I can't wake up  
There's something strange that I can not control  
This makes me crazy but I `?`

Every day passing by seems colder than yesterday  
It `?` for me is gone  
`?-?`  
Still `?` pain will finally fade away  
And the clouds over might fall`/`form  
Tell me why am I faltered

How is it the stars will show me the way home  
Before there's nothing left for us to foresee  
At the edge of my life `?`  
`?-?`  
How there's so much and so little remains  
But how I can not cry I can not let it go  
`?-?`  
Cries`*` more than I knew`*`

`chorus:`  
I don't wanna face what I `?`  
The way `?`  
I don't know where can I set my spirit to peace  
`?-?`

`?` falling to the insanity`*`  
`?` falling down to the night  
I have returned all your pages`*` of `?`  
Still `?`  
I know some people who `?`  
I lost my virtue`*` `?`  
`?` watch this world burn to ashes  
`?-?`

Forgotten`*` into my `?`  
Can't find a way `?`  
`?-?`  
Hoping to see what is waiting for me at the end  
`?-?`  
`?-?`
