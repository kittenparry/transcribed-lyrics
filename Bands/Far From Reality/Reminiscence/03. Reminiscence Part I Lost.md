### Reminiscence Part I: Lost
I `?` quite`*` scaring me to the death  
Lost in the crowd  
It can not hear me screaming in the dark  
It `?`  
I can't `?`  
`?-?`  
Lost in the crowds  
`?-?`

There's no choice in hell no chance to escape  
`?-?`

Beyond this the forever lost in time  
`?-?`  
I know I'll never find  
Lost in the `?`  
Lost in my `?` lost in the dark  
Waiting for you `?`  
Can you hear my calling  
`?-?`  
`?-?`  
`?-?`  
`?-?`

`chorus:`  
Long lost memories  
They're just a dream or fantasy  
`?-?`  
`?-?`  
Gone now yet I'm full of hate  
`?-?`  
`?-?`  
My spirit has `?`  
Nothing to `?` nothing to wipe my tears
