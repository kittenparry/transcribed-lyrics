### Reminiscence Part II: Regrets
He lost his soul somewhere into her eyes  
In a ocean of dreams where he could hide  
No matter if the world is burning outside  
He just let it drift into the haze of time

A heaven that even god could not find  
A life that even `?` couldn't have in mind  
But it would never guess how fast time can pass by  
How's the summer left `?` from the sky  
It was too late to realise what was really worth to fight  
He hid his soul somewhere and for the first time

But the river now is dense  
Walking toward dead ends  
Remembering all that he lost  
By his own `?`  
Still a ghost of happiness  
Remains deep inside his head`*`  
Reminiscence of all regrets

He lost his soul somewhere into her eyes  
In a ocean of void with nowhere to hide  
Have him mercy of the world that has burned outside  
He knew that he would never have his soul back alive
