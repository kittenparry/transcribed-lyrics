### Waiting
`?` concerned  
I had hopes but `?`  
I am getting weaker `?`  
`?-?`

`chorus:`  
I'm scared are you waiting for his answers`*`  
Am I going to die  
How much longer can I survive  
`?-?`  
Is there a `?`  
Can I fall asleep at night  
Am I going to start to `?`  
No I don't want you to hear the words I `?`  
Everyone has to die one day  
Will I be able to see the worlds I `?`  
There's only one way to find out  
Only one way to find out

Just a `?` cure the pain  
`?-?`  
`?-?`  
`?-?`

`(Go away)*`
