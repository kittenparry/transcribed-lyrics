### Red Horizon
Stormy`*` sea no turning back  
Lost belief well`*` the moon is black  
Northern lights guiding my way  
Mighty thunder crowning the day

`chorus:`  
No sign of light  
Just a pitch black `?`  
No shore in sight  
Darkness covers the light  
Red horizon `(stay in control alone)*`  
Me and my ship never ending trip

Rages on trying to fall`~` asleep  
Red horizon creeping me so deep  
Shooting star falling from the sky  
Sun is running out it's time to dawn`/`die

Blood red horizon
