### Wings of Death
From the depth of the `?`  
Something came that no one could not believe  
Sun was shining people smiled  
Last day in this ending paradise

`chorus:`  
Can you hear all this fear  
End is near take your last breath  
`?` try to hide from the wings of death  
Wings of death

The power of nature can be strong  
Human being has ruled the earth too long  
Motherless children without a home  
Saw the destruction of future
