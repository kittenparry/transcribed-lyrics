### Touch of Danger
Fly like an eagle to the eye of the storm  
In the stream`~` have to live on your own  
`?` the damage is done  
What's left inside you can't deny

`chorus:`  
If there's a heaven it`/`that turns to hell  
Don't ever wish for a pleasure  
If there's a light it`/`that turns to dark  
Don't ever dream of sunshine  
Is that real or just fantasy  
`?-?`  
Touch of danger feel the stranger  
Touch of danger you're the stranger

Cold wind is blowing at the end of the road  
Your fear`*` is watching everywhere you go  
Gold and silver `?` than steel that's how you feel
