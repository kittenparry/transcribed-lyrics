### Primitive
Watching this world full of madness and fear  
Battles are waging on`*` year after year  
Nations are hating each other so bad  
The situation is making me mad  

`chorus:`  
Human mind is mystery  
Lying`*` eyes hard to see  
I have lost all belief  
I've got nothing to give  
I'm primitive I'm uncaged`*`  
I'm primitive I'm so `?`

Running like madman no place to hide  
`?-?`  
`?` there's nothing for me  
No mercy for people no sympathy

`?-?`
