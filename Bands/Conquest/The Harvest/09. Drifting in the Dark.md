### Drifting in the Dark
No this night I can't`*`  
I can't remember when this nightmare turned into reality  
Look I just can't see  
I'm blind I must believe this coldness is not what it seems

`chorus:`  
Diving`*` into the void  
`?-?`  
Reaching the highest `?`  
I climb `(and yet)*` I fall  
Yet`*` I fall  
Drifting in the dark  

Darkness follows me  
Hanging tree is waiting  
Burning blood running through my veins  
Lead`*` me through the darkest night  
`?-?`  
No prayer for the `?`
