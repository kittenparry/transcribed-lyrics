### Vanishing
Since I was gone darkness around  
Choirs`*` has been gone moving`*` crowd  
Twinkling stars healing scars  
Searching for you  
Searching for me

`chorus:`  
Vanishing merries`*` in my mind  
Vanishing merries`*` I've left behind  
Vanishing merries`*` I'll never find

`?` burns makes me concerned  
Windmill turns all that I've learned  
Howl`*` in the moon just waiting soon  
Waiting for you  
Waiting for me

Vanishing merries`*` deep inside
