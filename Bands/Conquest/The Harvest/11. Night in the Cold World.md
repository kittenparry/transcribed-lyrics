### Night in the Cold World
I'm alone in my empty room  
Staring outta window  
Just waiting for your call  
Tonight I hear the bells of doom`*`  
Watching frozen rainbow  
Hoping you understand these all

`chorus:`  
When I take a look at the above sky  
I've got a feeling I could fly  
Thousands of stars `?`  
Why don't you give me a try  
I cry and cry  
Will there be a chance for me tonight  
All the nights in the cold world  
I try and try to get out of the dark  
And see the lights  
Northern`*` lights in the cold world

I was your clown you made me crawl  
Never know that I gave you all  
Nowhere that's where I go  
You broke my heart  
You killed my soul  
Left me sleeping all alone  
Babe I'm missing you so

I cry and cry  
Day after day  
I'm asking why you left me lone in this cold world  
I try I try to forget your last kiss goodbye  
Babe
