### The Harvest
Leaves are frozen summer's gone  
Time to turn the page  
The mind is restless trying to hold the rage`*`
Vicious thoughts hollow smiles  
Many whispered `?`  
After million miles what life `?`  

`chorus:`  
So `?` borrowed time  
`?-?`

Searching for the highest `?`  
Reaching for the sky  
Sometimes you have to stop`*` learn to fly  
The world has turned to black and blue  
Storm is in the air  
Time has come to let you in despair

Your portrait is staring my vision on the wall  
The harvest will rise and `?` before the fall  
Before the fall  
The harvest `?`

No one will hear you cry  
Thousands of scars inside
