### Armageddon
Remember those times when we need each other so bad  
Each unfortunate crime to lose all that we had  
Greed and lust are the ways to destroy your soul  
I don't wanna see the time when hammer falls

`chorus:`  
Don't break the silence listen to sea  
`?-?`  
Wake up and see fights till the end  
Keep the faith never leave your friend  
What are we living for  
What are we doing  
Armageddon  
Don't stop believe and save your last `?`

How many years is left in this human race  
Is there a chance to see any smiling face  
Look back your life and think what have you done  
`?` everything's gone

The fight goes on and on  
Never leave your friend keep the faith  
Defend till the end

Here we are all alone  
Take my hand follow me

Count down to zero  
Last fighting hero  
Darkness is calling  
Silence is calling
