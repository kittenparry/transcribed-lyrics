### Rock the Rook Off
Owl in the nights crowd is `?`  
Fire in `?` bodies in heat  
Lights go down curtain opens  
When it's rock hands in the air

`chorus:`  
Music leads you far away to the other side  
Rock will take your soul tonight go wild`*`  
Rock the rook off

`?` drives you crazy  
Scream and shouts `?`  
Lightning strikes the sky is burning  
`?-?`  

We're gonna rock the rook off
