### Contributing Guidelines (WIP)

* No punctuation
* Two spaces to end lines (except end of verses)
* No screams or extra sound effects like `oh, yeah` etc.
* All chorus should be after `chorus:` in one verse if possible
* `instrumental` should be used to complete the track list of an album for an instrumental song instead of an empty file or no file
* Naming files: `Bands\band-name\album-name\track-number. track-name.md`  
Example: `Bands\Conquest\The Harvest\01. Primitive.md`
* Use [these guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Titles#Capital_letters) for naming of artists/albums/songs
* `###` for song titles
* Pronoun `I` is always capitalised
* First word of every line is capitalised
* Author's judgement should be used separating lines and verses
* Links to the web pages with somewhat of a description of the album and the artist should be provided within the README file inside the album folder
